Version 1.2.6117; September 30, 2016
	- Use MSGFResultsSummarizer.dll for determining unique peptides and for identifying Keratin and Trypsin-contaminant proteins

Version 1.2.6008; September 26, 2016
	- Improve logic validating that required MASIC files are present

Version 1.2.6008; June 13, 2016
	- New version of PHRPReader.dll that does not depend on ThermoRawFileReader.dll

Version 1.2.6003; June 8, 2016
	- Replaced ThermoRawFileReaderDLL.dll with ThermoRawFileReader.dll

Version 1.2.5990; May 26, 2016
	- New versions of PHRPReader and ThermoRawFileReader
	- Update to .NET 4.5.1

Version 1.2.5882; February 8, 2016
	- Added 4 new metrics
		- MS2_RepIon_All: Number of Filter-passing PSMs for which all of the reporter ions were seen
		- MS2_RepIon_1Missing: Number of Filter-passing PSMs for which 1 reporter ion was not observed
		- MS2_RepIon_2Missing: Number of Filter-passing PSMs for which 2 reporter ion were not observed
		- MS2_RepIon_3Missing: Number of Filter-passing PSMs for which 3 reporter ions were not observed
	- In the XML file listing the measurements to run, metric name * now means to compute all of the metrics

Version 1.2.5878; February 4, 2016
	- Added 2 new metrics
		- Trypsin_2A: Total PSMs from trypsin
		- Trypsin_2C: Unique peptides from trypsin

Version 1.2.5758; October 7, 2015
	- Added 4 new metrics
		- Keratin_2A: Total keratin PSMs
		- Keratin_2C: Unique keratin peptides
		- P_4A: Fraction fully-Tryptic
		- P_4B: Missed cleavage rate

Version 1.2.5686; July 24, 2015
	- When finding PSMs and unique peptide counts, now ignoring the position of modifications in peptides (though order still matters)
		- For example, PEPT*IDES and PEPTIDES* are treated as the same peptide
	- New PHRPReader that supports MSPathFinder results
	- Update to System.Data.SQLite.dll v1.0.93
	- Now compiling as AnyCPU

Version 1.2.5122; January 9, 2014

Version 1.2.5121; January 8, 2014
	- Added metrics Phos_2A and Phos_2C

Version 1.2.4930; July 1, 2013
	- Bug fix for MS1_5B

Version 1.2.4927; June 28, 2013
	- Only retaining the best scoring peptide for each scan/charge combo

Version 1.2.4925; June 26, 2013
	- Optimized SQL statements

Version 1.2.4912; June 13, 2013
	- Now uses PHRPReader to load PSM Results

Version 1.1.4885; May 17, 2013
	- Fixed bug in MS1_5_Shared; now computing delta mass using monoisotopic mass instead of m/z

Version 1.1.4653; September 27, 2012
	- Now computing corrected DelM errors by adding/subtracting C13 (affects MS1_5 metrics)

Version 1.0.4507; May 4, 2012
	- Initial release of v1.1
